## 🌱 Problem

Bitcoin is global — but its adoption often leaves out **small-scale entrepreneurs**, especially women and local businesses in LATAM.  
There’s a lack of simple, intuitive tools to **save, learn, and transact with Bitcoin** in real-world, culturally grounded contexts.

## 🌸 Vision

BitBitMami is a **gentle yet powerful onboarding journey** into Bitcoin’s ecosystem — designed as a **beautiful visual toolkit** for:

- 👛 Planning savings with sBTC
- 📚 Learning interactively about Bitcoin and MEV
- 🛍️ Mapping women-led businesses that accept Bitcoin
- 📲 Sending & receiving BTC with optional privacy via Rebar Shield
